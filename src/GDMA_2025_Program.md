  Title:  
  Optimization Algorithm and Framework Design for Federated Learning  
  Abstract:  
  Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for distributed machine learning, enabling model training across distributed devices while preserving data privacy. However, challenges such as heterogeneous data distributions, resource-constrained devices, and uncertain physical environments hinder its widespread adoption. In this talk, we explore how to design the optimization algorithm and framework of federated learning to address these challenges. Specifically, this talk will explore how to solve the problem of data heterogeneity using the heuristic searching strategies from the perspective of the loss landscape. In addition, this talk will introduce how to design the federated learning framework using asynchronous training and model heterogeneity strategies to address the problem of performance degradation caused by limited device resources and uncertain environments.
