# Call for Papers

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the application of graphs in different domains. Graphs have been widely used for data modeling in various application domains such as multimedia databases, protein networks, social networks, and the semantic web. With the continued emergence and increase of massive and complex structural graph data, a graph database that efficiently supports elementary data management mechanisms is crucially required to effectively understand and utilize any collection of graphs.

### Topics of Interest

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- Storing graph data.
- Indexing graph data.
- Supporting different types of graph queries.
- Estimating the selectivity of graph queries.
- Graph mining.
- Graph learning.
- Compact (compressed) representation of graph data.
- Measuring graph similarity.
- Graph query languages.
- Graph question answering.
- Graph data management for social network applications.
- Graph data management of multimedia databases.
- Graph data management of semantic web data.
- Graph data management for geometrical applications.
- Graph data management for business process management applications.
- Graph data management with LLMs.
- Graph learning with LLMs.
- Graph analysis with LLMs.
- Advanced applications and tools for managing graph databases in different domains.
