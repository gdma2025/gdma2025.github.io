# The 8th International Workshop on Graph Data Management and Analysis (GDMA 2024)

This workshop will be held in conjunction with DASFAA 2024 on **July 2, 2024**.

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the application of graphs in different domains. Graphs have been widely used for data modeling in various areas such as multimedia databases, protein networks, social networks, and the semantic web. With the continued emergence and increase of massive and complex structural graph data, a graph database that efficiently supports elementary data management mechanisms is crucially required to effectively understand and utilize any collection of graphs.

The overall goal of the workshop is to:
- Bring people from different fields together.
- Exchange research ideas and results.
- Encourage discussions about how to provide efficient graph data management techniques in different application domains.
- Understand the research challenges of this area.

The first international workshop on graph data management and analysis (GDMA 2017) was held in Beijing, China, in conjunction with APWeb-WAIM 2017. Subsequent workshops (GDMA 2018/2019/2020/2021) were held in conjunction with DASFAA from 2018 to 2021, respectively. 

The theme of GDMA 2022 was "**Multimodal Data Management and Analysis**." Having the workshop colocated with DASFAA as a leading database conference will undoubtedly help achieve the main goals of the workshop.
