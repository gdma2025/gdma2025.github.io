# The 9th International Workshop on Graph Data Management and Analysis (GDMA 2025) 
May 25-28, 2025, Singapore
In conjunction with the 30th International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications (DASFAA 2025)

Recently, there has been a lot of interest in the application of graphs in different domains. They have been widely used for data modeling of different application domains such as multimedia databases, protein networks, social networks and semantic web. With the continued emergence and increase of massive and complex structural graph data, a graph database that efficiently supports elementary data management mechanisms is crucially required to effectively understand and utilize any collection of graphs.
The overall goal of the workshop is to bring people from different fields together, exchange research ideas and results, and encourage discussion about how to provide efficient graph data management techniques in different application domains and to understand the research challenges of such area. The first international workshop on graph data management and analysis (GDMA 2017) was held in Beijing, China in conjunction with APWeb-WAIM 2017 and GDMA 2018-2024 was held in conjunction with DASFAA 2018-2023, respectively. The theme of GDMA 2024 is “LLMs-based Graph Management and Analysis”. Having the workshop collocated with DASFAA as a leading database conference will definitely help to achieve the main goals of the workshop.

The overall goal of the workshop is to:
- Bring people from different fields together.
- Exchange research ideas and results.
- Encourage discussions about how to provide efficient graph data management techniques in different application domains.
- Understand the research challenges of this area.
